    "message": "Hello \uD83D\uDC4B\nI’m Nicolas SANS, an experienced full-stack developer passionate about the web, robust, reliable, and innovative solutions.\n\nWith a five-year degree from Epitech Nantes, I honed my expertise through roles as a consultant and Salesforce developer at Capgemini NANTES, where I am currently continuing my journey. Driven by a love for technical challenges and a constant search for efficient solutions, I specialize in Rust \uD83E\uDD80, a high-performance language that enables me to design resource-efficient projects, supporting a more eco-friendly approach to development.\n\nMy experience includes a wide range of solutions, from native and cross-platform mobile applications in React Native and Flutter \uD83D\uDCF1 to IoT projects with ESP32 in C and C++. During my studies, I also developed a SaaS application using React, NestJS, and MongoDB to meet practical needs of my peers.\n\nIn parallel, I built and managed a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster, complete with a GitOps architecture, ensuring reliable and automated deployments.\n\nI am serious, adaptable, and enjoy both the design and deployment of complex projects. My expertise also includes implementing robust solutions on AWS and Azure, with proven experience on large-scale projects (up to 300,000 clients).\n\nI am currently open to part-time projects. Contact me to discuss your ideas!"
